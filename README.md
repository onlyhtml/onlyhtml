# OnlyHtml
OnlyHtml is Static Site Generator that helps you build simple websites. You write the front-end code using handlebars templates and OnlyHtml will handle all the back-end tasks, creating a Dashboard CMS for you and managing rendering and  deployments.

OnlyHtml is a companion to Headless CMS systems like Sanity.io, so you get the best experience editing your content while focusing only on the front-end code

### OnlyHtml Main Goals
- It does most of what you need, but probably not everything.
- You only need to know HTML (plus CSS and JS to the extent that your design calls for it).
- You should be able to learn the basics in a few minutes.
- Bring your own Headless CMS of choice or use simple markdown files 

### Get Started
Start from a template project
- https://github.com/onlyhtml/starter-sanity
- https://github.com/onlyhtml/starter-vanila

Or by reading the docs https://galtashma.gitbook.io/onlyhtml/  
Or by `npm install -g @onlyhtml/onlyhtml`

Happy Hacking!
